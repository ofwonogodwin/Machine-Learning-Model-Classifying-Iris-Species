**Iris Classification Model**
**Project Overview**
This project is a machine learning model designed to classify Iris flower species (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica) based on their sepal and petal dimensions. The model was trained and evaluated using the Iris dataset, a classic dataset in machine learning.
**Features**
**Data**: The model uses the well-known Iris dataset, which includes 150 samples with 4 features (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width) and 3 target classes.
**Algorithm**: K-Nearest Neighbors
**Accuracy**: 97%
**Installation**
To run this project locally, youâ€™ll need:

**Python 3.**
**Required libraries** (Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Scikit Learn, Mglearn)
**Step-by-Step Guide**
Clone the repository:
**git clone //https://github.com/ofwonogodwin/Machine-Learning-Model-Classifying-Iris-Species**
install the required libraries:

**Usage**
**Training**: Adjust parameters in the model file to retrain the model.
**Testing**: Use your data or test samples to evaluate model performance.
**Future Improvements**
Implement hyperparameter tuning for better accuracy.
Experiment with other algorithms or ensemble methods.
